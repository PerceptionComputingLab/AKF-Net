# Dataset

This work uses a private dataset. Due to some factors, only part of the data is given here to test the operation of the code in `dataset/sample_data`.

# Training

- **Step 1.** In the `main_train.py` file, modify the statement `os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES']` to select the GPU you want to use. For example, set `os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES']='0'` to use the first GPU.
- **Step 2.** In the `config.py` file, modify the key named `dataset_path` to specify the data path
- **Step 3.** Set the training parameters in the `config.py` file
- **Step 4.** Execute the command to perform training
```
python main_train.py
```

# Inference

- **Step 1.** The breakpoints of the model training will be saved in the `runs` directory. Select the absolute path of the model breakpoint to be inferred and copy it to the `checkpoint_path` field in the `config.py` file.
- **Step 2.** In the `main_test.py` file, modify the statement `os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES']` to select the GPU you want to use.
- **Step 3.** Execute the command to perform inference
```
python main_test.py
```
